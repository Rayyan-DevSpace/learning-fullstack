JavaScript Fundamentals: Threading & Operations

1. Single-Threaded Nature
- JavaScript is a single-threaded language
- Can only execute one task at a time
- No parallel execution

2. Types of Operations

A. Synchronous (Blocking) Operations
- Tasks execute one after another
- Each task must complete before next begins
- Example scenario:
    * Data fetch (takes 10s) → Site freezes
    * Display data
    * Mathematical operations (2**3, 2*4)
    * Other operations

B. Asynchronous Operations
- Helps manage long-running tasks
- Uses single thread efficiently
- How it works:
    * Long tasks (like database fetches) are delegated
    * setTimeout function helps manage delayed execution
    * Main thread remains free for other operations
    * Prevents site from freezing
