Functions
-> Built-in Functions
-> User define Functions

Popups
-> Alert (like Notifications)
-> Confirm (Like delete permissions)
-> Prompt (User input dialogue box): One input at a time

Popups can't run on terminals
-> To run these we need browser, to be more precise we need HTML page
-> don't validate input whether user input value or not


DOM
-> Stands for Document Object Model

To change heading interactivity we need those header in JS like give access to js for h2

-> We can do that by DOM
-> document.queryselector("#one")
