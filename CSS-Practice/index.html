      <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
      <p class="cls02">
        Artificial Intelligence refers to systems that perform tasks which
        normally require human intelligence. These systems analyze data,
        recognize patterns, and make decisions or recommendations. Common
        examples include virtual assistants, image and speech recognition, and
        recommendation engines that personalize content or services.
      </p>
      <h3>Blockchain</h3>
      <p class="cls02">
        Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that records
        transactions in a secure, tamper-resistant way. Each record (or block)
        links to the previous one, creating a chain that is distributed across
        many participants. This design supports trustless transactions,
        transparent audit trails, and applications like secure record-keeping,
        tokenized assets, and smart contracts.
      </p>

      <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
      <p class="cls02">
        Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) that can represent multiple
        states at once, enabling certain computations to be done differently
        than on classical computers. Quantum machines are explored for tasks
        such as optimization, cryptography research, and simulating complex
        physical systems where classical approaches may be slow or impractical.

          Loved the whole experience — fast delivery and the product looked even
          better in person. Customer support answered all my questions quickly.
          Will definitely buy again!

          Exceptionally well-made and exactly as advertised. The packaging was
          neat and the extras were a thoughtful touch. Highly recommend for

          The product is decent and does the job, but shipping took longer than
          expected. Overall okay value — would consider buying again if delivery
          improves.
